# UI-Automation - Automation Exercise

This exercise is performed using Selenium Webdriver with JUnit.

Steps to configure and Run -

# Install Eclipse IDE 
# Copy and paste the folder "Sample Web Automation" at your eclipse-workspace folder
# From Eclipse IDE, go to Files -> Open Projects from File System -> provide path of the "Sample Web Automation" copied under eclipse-workspace
# Once the project is imported follow below steps to make sure all the files are loaded -
	# Expand "Sample Web Automation" from Project Explorer 
	# Expand "src/main/java". Make sure package "com.test.automation.impl" is present
	# Expand "com.test.automation.impl". Make sure "HomePage.java" and "Webdriver.java" are present
# As we are using Chrome driver here, make sure you have Google Chrome browser installed on your system
# Now open the "Webdriver.java" by double clicking on it
# To run the script, go to Run -> Run (ctrl + F11). Alternatively, from Toolbar, click on Run button
# Script will run and console will display the outputs.
# Once the execution is finished, JUnit will display the results 


Here I have used "HomePage.java" to locate the pop-up message and use it in "Webdriver.java"
